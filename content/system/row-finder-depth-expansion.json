  "title": "Row Finder Depth Expansion",
  "type": "delta",
  "updated": "2026-02-27",
  "summary": "Row generation must expand into under-covered tools and asymmetric pairs to preserve inevitable decisions.",
  "what_this_is": "Defines the expansion rule for producing high-quality rows once obvious comparisons are exhausted.",
  "structural_problem": "Without enforced expansion, Row Finder repeats dominant tools and overlapping logic, reducing viable rows.",
  "rule": "Row Finder must include credible mid-tier tools and asymmetric pairings; every row must be mechanism-based and constraint-amplified.",
  "tradeoff": "Including less common tools may reduce immediate search volume in exchange for coverage and uniqueness.",
  "failure_mode": "Rows become repetitive, triage rejection rises, production slows, and category gaps persist.",
  "structural_impact": "Scaling depends on systematic tool-set expansion, not weakened triage or diluted comparisons."
