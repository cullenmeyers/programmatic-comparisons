  "summary": "Every verdict must include mechanism and friction, not only constraint and failure.",
  "what_this_is": "Defines the minimum explanatory density required for a comparison to remain valid at scale.",
  "structural_problem": "Constraint-only verdicts create semantic repetition and corpus interchangeability.",
  "rule": "Every failure claim must specify the concrete mechanism and the user-facing friction it produces under the constraint.",
  "tradeoff": "Comparisons lacking behavioral grounding are rejected or delayed.",
  "failure_mode": "Pages become thin, repetitive, and less credible as claims detach from observable behavior.",
  "structural_impact": "Row Triage and Page Factory must enforce mechanism → friction → failure to preserve distinction at scale."
