  "summary": "The winner is determined by which tool fails first under the locked persona constraint.",
  "what_this_is": "Defines the invariant decision logic across all comparisons to enforce inevitability through constraint-driven failure.",
  "structural_problem": "Without a dominant invariant, comparisons degrade into feature lists or subjective preferences that do not scale.",
  "rule": "Every verdict must resolve as a failure-first outcome under the locked persona constraint.",
  "tradeoff": "Comparisons lacking inevitable failure logic are excluded.",
  "failure_mode": "Verdicts become debatable, pages homogenize, and structural differentiation collapses.",
  "structural_impact": "All generation, triage, gates, and tools must preserve constraint-first failure as the root decision rule."
