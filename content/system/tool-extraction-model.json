  "summary": "Reusable tools are derived from repeated constraint-driven failure logic.",
  "what_this_is": "Defines the permanent rule for converting recurring decision patterns into deterministic tools.",
  "structural_problem": "Without extraction, decision logic remains trapped in content and cannot compound into durable utilities.",
  "rule": "When identical constraint-driven failure logic recurs across comparisons, it must be formalized as a deterministic tool or gate.",
  "tradeoff": "Tool creation is restricted to validated patterns; one-off ideas are excluded.",
  "failure_mode": "Tools detach from the corpus, reuse collapses, and compounding stops.",
  "structural_impact": "The corpus remains the source of truth; tools are invariant outputs of repeated decision logic."
