  "title": "Comparison Production Engine",
  "type": "architecture",
  "updated": "2026-02-27",
  "summary": "All comparison pages are produced exclusively through Row Finder → Row Triage → Page Factory.",
  "what_this_is": "Defines the sole authorized production pipeline for comparison pages.",
  "structural_problem": "Without a single pipeline, logic diverges, quality varies, and structure fragments.",
  "rule": "Every comparison page must originate from one Row Finder row, pass Row Triage, and be generated by Page Factory into the fixed schema.",
  "tradeoff": "Pages that fail triage are not produced; speed is subordinate to structural integrity.",
  "failure_mode": "Outputs become inconsistent, verdict logic loses determinism, and compounding breaks.",
  "structural_impact": "Scaling occurs only by refining the pipeline, never by manual edits or per-page structural variation."
