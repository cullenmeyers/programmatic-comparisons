"verdict": {
"winner": "y",
"summary": "Apple Calendar wins for minimalists who only want to view their daily schedule. It displays events exactly as entered, without auto scheduling tasks or reshuffling time blocks. Motion adds an automated planning engine that schedules tasks into open slots and adjusts them as your day changes. If automated planning adds extra interaction steps, Motion fails first.",

{
"type": "persona_fit",
"heading": "Why this matters for Minimalists",

"faqs": [
{
"q": "Does Motion replace my calendar?",
"a": "It connects to your existing calendar and adds automated task scheduling on top, which means more layers rather than a simple event view."
},
{
"q": "Is Apple Calendar too basic?",
"a": "It is basic by design, which keeps the interface focused on viewing and adding events without task planning tools."
},
{
"q": "Will Motion constantly change my schedule?",
"a": "It can move flexible tasks when meetings change, since its planning engine reshuffles blocks based on priorities."
},
{
"q": "Which one is calmer to look at each day?",
"a": "Apple Calendar is usually calmer because it shows only scheduled events without automated task blocks."
