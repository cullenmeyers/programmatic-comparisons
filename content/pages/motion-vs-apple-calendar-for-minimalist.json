{
"q": "Is automation always bad for minimalists?",
"a": "Not always, but if automation adds decisions or interaction steps, it can undermine the simplicity minimalists value."

"q": "What’s the simplest way to view a daily schedule?",
"a": "A focused calendar like Apple Calendar keeps the interface centered on events without blending in planning systems."
},
{
"q": "Can I use Motion in a minimalist way?",
"a": "You can limit feature use, but its core value comes from automation, which may still introduce extra layers."
},
{
"q": "How do I know if features are adding friction?",
"a": "If you open the app to check events and end up adjusting settings or reviewing plans, the tool may be too complex for your needs."
