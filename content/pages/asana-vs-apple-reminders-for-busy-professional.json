"verdict": {
"winner": "y",
"summary": "Apple Reminders wins for busy professionals because it allows instant task capture with almost no thinking. Asana expects tasks to live inside projects and structure, which adds friction at the moment ideas appear. When speed matters more than organization, Apple Reminders keeps momentum intact.",

{
"q": "Why does Apple Reminders feel faster?",
"a": "Because it allows tasks to be added without categorization or planning."
},
{
"q": "Can busy professionals use both tools?",
"a": "Yes. Some capture tasks in Apple Reminders and later move them into Asana if needed."
},
{
"q": "What’s the biggest risk during fast-paced workdays?",
"a": "Losing tasks because capture required too much thinking."
