"verdict": {
"winner": "y",
"summary": "Google Calendar wins for minimalists who want events separate and easy to scan. It centers on a time grid with meetings placed exactly where you add them. Notion Calendar connects events to Notion workspaces and databases, adding extra panels and linked views. If integrated workspace layers create extra decisions, Notion Calendar fails first.",

"why_it_matters": "There are no required workspace properties or linked database selections when adding a meeting."

{
"q": "Does Notion Calendar replace Google Calendar?",
"a": "It can sync with existing calendars but adds workspace context and database connections on top of basic scheduling."
},
{
"q": "Is Google Calendar minimal by default?",
"a": "Yes, its main interface focuses on time based events without requiring document or database links."
},
{
"q": "Can I ignore extra features in Google Calendar?",
"a": "Yes, optional tools like tasks are separate, so you can use it purely as an event calendar."
},
{
"q": "Which tool feels lighter for daily viewing?",
"a": "Google Calendar usually feels lighter because it does not blend scheduling with workspace databases."
