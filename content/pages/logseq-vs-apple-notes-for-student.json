"verdict": {
"winner": "y",
"summary": "Apple Notes wins for students who need quick study notes for current classes and exams. It works like a simple folder-based notebook with search and optional tags. Logseq centers on linked blocks, daily journals, and file-based graphs that take time to understand. If learning the system takes longer than the course itself, Logseq fails first.",

"faqs": [
{
"q": "Is Logseq difficult for short-term class use?",
"a": "It can feel complex because it relies on blocks, links, and file management rather than simple documents."

{
"q": "Can Apple Notes handle exam prep?",
"a": "Yes. With folders and search, it works well for organizing and reviewing class material."
},
{
"q": "Will I lose flexibility by choosing Apple Notes?",
"a": "For simple semester notes, you usually do not need advanced linking features."
},
{
"q": "Which is easier to switch away from later?",
"a": "Apple Notes is easier for short-term use because it does not require learning a specialized workflow."
