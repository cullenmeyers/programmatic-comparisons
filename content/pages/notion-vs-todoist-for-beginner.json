"meta_description": "A beginner-friendly comparison of Notion vs Todoist for tracking daily tasks without setup, systems, or configuration overhead.",
"persona": "Beginner",
"constraint_lens": "You have a low tolerance for setup and configuration, so the best tool is the one that lets you add and check off tasks immediately.",
"verdict": {
"winner": "y",
"summary": "Todoist wins for beginners because it lets you start adding tasks instantly without designing a system. Notion is flexible, but that flexibility requires upfront decisions that delay the first task. When the goal is simple daily task tracking, Todoist removes friction and builds consistency.",
"decision_rule": "If the user must design a system before adding tasks, Notion fails first."

"sections": [
{
"type": "persona_fit",
"heading": "What beginners need to track daily tasks",
"content": "Beginners need tools that feel obvious and forgiving. The right task app should make adding and completing tasks the default behavior, without asking users to think about structure first."

{
"point": "You already know exactly how you want to organize tasks",

},
{
"point": "Tasks are part of a broader planning system",
"why_it_matters": "If tasks live alongside notes and plans, Notion can consolidate tools—but only after setup effort."
},
{
"point": "You enjoy experimenting with layouts",
"why_it_matters": "Some beginners like tinkering. Most just want to check things off."

},
{
"point": "The interface is task-focused",
"why_it_matters": "Fewer options mean fewer distractions when all you want is a to-do list."
},

"point": "Completion is simple and satisfying",

"faqs": [
{
"q": "Is Notion too complex for beginner task tracking?",
"a": "Often yes, because it requires upfront decisions about structure before tasks can be added."
},
{
"q": "Why does Todoist feel easier to use?",
"a": "Because it’s built specifically for tasks and removes setup and configuration from the process."
},
{
"q": "Can beginners switch from Todoist to Notion later?",
"a": "Yes. Starting simple builds the habit first, making future transitions easier."
},
{
"q": "What’s the biggest mistake beginners make with task apps?",
"a": "Choosing a flexible system before they’ve built the habit of tracking tasks at all."
