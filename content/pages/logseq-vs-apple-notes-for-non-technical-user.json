"persona": "Non-technical user",
"constraint_lens": "You have a fear of breaking things, so the best tool is the one that hides storage and syncing details and feels safe by default.",
"verdict": {
"winner": "y",
"summary": "Apple Notes wins for non-technical users because it hides where data lives and how syncing works. Logseq exposes file-based concepts that can create anxiety about doing something wrong. When reliability and peace of mind matter more than control, Apple Notes feels safer and easier to trust.",
"decision_rule": "If the user worries about where data lives or how it syncs, Logseq fails first."

"heading": "When Logseq can still work despite fear of breaking things",
"bullets": [
{
"point": "You are comfortable knowing notes are stored as local files",
"why_it_matters": "Logseq assumes comfort with file-based storage. Without that comfort, visibility creates stress instead of confidence."
},
{
"point": "You rarely think about syncing across devices",
"why_it_matters": "Logseq feels simpler when sync is not part of the daily workflow. Multiple devices increase perceived risk."
},
{
"point": "You enjoy structure and outlines once they are set",
"why_it_matters": "If the system feels stable and untouched, Logseq’s model can work—but only if the user isn’t tempted to adjust it."

"point": "Notes feel managed and protected",

"faqs": [
{
"q": "Is Logseq unsafe for non-technical users?",
"a": "Not unsafe, but it exposes storage and syncing concepts that can create anxiety for users who fear breaking things."
},
{
"q": "Why does Apple Notes feel safer?",
"a": "Because it hides technical details and manages syncing automatically in the background."
},
{
"q": "Can a non-technical user grow into Logseq later?",
"a": "Yes, once comfort with files and syncing increases and the desire for control outweighs fear."
},
{
"q": "What’s the biggest risk for non-technical users choosing note apps?",
"a": "Choosing a tool that exposes system mechanics and undermines confidence instead of building trust."
