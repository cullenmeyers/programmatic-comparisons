"persona": "Minimalist",
"constraint_lens": "You want a quiet writing space that does not surface systems, graphs, or extra structure.",
"verdict": {
"winner": "y",
"summary": "Bear wins for minimalists who want calm writing without system thinking. It centers on a simple text editor with light tags and minimal panels. Roam Research constantly surfaces backlinks, block handles, and graph structure that remind you of the system behind your notes. If backlinks and structure add mental noise, Roam fails first.",

"sections": [
{
"type": "persona_fit",
"heading": "Best fit for calm, focused writing",
"content": "You want to write without feeling pulled into a system. Bear keeps the screen centered on text with a small note list and optional tags. Roam is built around linking ideas and showing connections, which can feel like extra layers when you only want a clean page."

"heading": "Where Roam Research wins",
"bullets": [
{
"point": "Automatic backlinks using double brackets",
"why_it_matters": "Typing double brackets creates links between notes instantly. This builds a network of ideas, but the visible linking behavior keeps structure front and center."
},
{
"point": "Block-based outline editor",
"why_it_matters": "Each line is a movable block that can be nested and rearranged. This supports complex thinking, yet the indentation controls and block bullets are always present."
},
{
"point": "Graph view of note connections",
"why_it_matters": "You can open a visual map of how notes connect. For minimalists, this visual layer may feel like noise unrelated to simple writing."

{
"type": "y_wins",
"heading": "Where Bear wins",
"bullets": [
{
"point": "Clean document-style editor without visible block handles",
"why_it_matters": "Text flows like a normal document without structural markers beside each paragraph. This keeps attention on sentences instead of systems."
},
{
"point": "Tagging with simple hashtags inside notes",
"why_it_matters": "You organize by typing a hashtag in the text. There are no backlink panels or reference counters appearing automatically."
},
{
"point": "Minimal sidebar and optional focus mode",
"why_it_matters": "You can hide the note list and write on a nearly blank screen. This reduces on-screen elements that are not directly related to writing."

"faqs": [
{
"q": "Is Roam too complex for minimalists?",
"a": "It is not unusable, but its linking and block system stay visible and can feel busy."
},
{
"q": "Does Bear support linking between notes?",
"a": "It supports note links and tags, but without the constant backlink panels or graph view."
},
{
"q": "Which feels calmer on screen?",
"a": "Bear usually feels calmer because it shows fewer structural elements while you write."
},
{
"q": "Can I ignore Roam graph view?",
"a": "Yes, but backlinks and block structure remain part of the main writing experience."
