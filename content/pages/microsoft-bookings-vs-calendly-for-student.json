"verdict": {
"winner": "y",
"summary": "Calendly wins for students who need temporary booking links for a short academic project. It lets you create a simple event link without building a full business profile. Microsoft Bookings is tied to Microsoft 365 and often expects staff setup and service details. If enterprise setup exceeds project duration, Microsoft Bookings fails first.",

"faqs": [
{
"q": "Is Microsoft Bookings only for businesses?",
"a": "It is designed around services and staff management inside Microsoft 365, which can feel business oriented for a short student project."
},
{
"q": "Can I create a quick link in Calendly without much setup?",
"a": "Yes, you can define one event type, set availability, and immediately share a booking link."
},
{
"q": "Which tool is easier to stop using after the semester?",
"a": "Calendly is usually easier to abandon because you are not required to maintain a structured service and staff setup."
},
{
"q": "Do both tools sync with calendars?",
"a": "Yes, both connect to major calendar accounts so confirmed meetings appear automatically."
