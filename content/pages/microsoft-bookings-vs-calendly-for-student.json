"winner": "y",
"summary": "Calendly is the better choice for a student who needs temporary booking links for a short academic project. Microsoft Bookings often assumes a more formal or enterprise-style configuration. If setup and account structure exceed the project’s duration, Calendly keeps things lightweight and easy to drop once the semester ends.",
"decision_rule": "If enterprise setup exceeds project duration, Microsoft Bookings fails first."

"content": "You only need scheduling links for a limited period, not a long-term system. With short-term use and low switching cost as priorities, speed and simplicity matter more than deep configuration. Calendly allows quick link creation, while Microsoft Bookings can introduce structure that outlasts the project itself."

"faqs": [
{
"q": "Which tool is faster to set up for a short project?",
"a": "Calendly is typically faster for creating a simple booking link without defining services or organizational roles."
},
{
"q": "Is Microsoft Bookings overkill for student projects?",
"a": "It can be if the project is short and informal. Its structure is more suited to ongoing or institutional scheduling."
},
{
"q": "Can I switch tools mid-project if needed?",
"a": "Yes. For short-term academic use, switching is common and usually low-risk, especially with link-based scheduling."
},
{
"q": "What matters most for student scheduling tools?",
"a": "Speed of setup, ease of sharing, and the ability to stop using the tool without long-term commitments."
