"constraint_lens": "You face time scarcity and cognitive overload, so any automation that requires supervision or negotiation becomes extra mental work.",
"verdict": {
"winner": "y",
"summary": "Todoist wins for busy professionals because it supports execution without trying to control the day. Motion’s automated scheduling can become another system to monitor, which adds cognitive load instead of reducing it. When attention is limited, simple lists beat intelligent planners.",
