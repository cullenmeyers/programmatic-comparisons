"summary": "Obsidian wins for power users building an extensible second brain. It stores notes as local Markdown files and supports a large community plugin ecosystem.

},
{
"q": "Which has the higher extensibility ceiling?",
"a": "Obsidian generally has the higher ceiling due to plugins and direct file access."
