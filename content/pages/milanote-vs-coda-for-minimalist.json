"verdict": {
"winner": "x",
"summary": "Milanote wins for minimalists who want spatial brainstorming without database-style complexity. It uses a drag-and-drop canvas where notes and images sit freely.

"q": "Does Coda always look like a spreadsheet?",
"a": "Many Coda pages use table blocks with columns and formulas, which resemble spreadsheets."

{
"q": "Can I brainstorm in Coda without tables?",
"a": "Yes, but the platform encourages structured blocks and database-style organization."
},
{
"q": "Which feels lighter for visual idea mapping?",
"a": "Milanote generally feels lighter because it centers on a freeform canvas."
