"persona": "Solo user",
"constraint_lens": "You have zero tolerance for ongoing maintenance, so the best task tool is the one that works without project upkeep or coordination rituals.",
"verdict": {
"winner": "y",
"summary": "Microsoft To Do wins for solo users because it focuses purely on personal tasks without assuming collaboration. Basecamp is built around projects and team coordination, which adds structural overhead. When you manage tasks alone and want them to stay usable without upkeep, Microsoft To Do is the lighter fit.",
"decision_rule": "If the tool assumes team coordination or project upkeep, Basecamp fails first."

"why_it_matters": "Separate project areas help only if they’re maintained. Otherwise, they create drift."
},
{
"point": "You plan to collaborate later",

"point": "There are no coordination assumptions",
