"verdict": {
"winner": "y",
"summary": "Todoist is the better fit for a Minimalist who wants a clean daily list without extra structure. Sunsama encourages structured daily planning sessions that can feel mandatory over time. If daily rituals start becoming required to use the tool properly, Todoist stays lighter and less intrusive.",

"type": "persona_fit",

"content": "You want to write down tasks and move on, not participate in a structured daily routine. With feature aversion, the right tool minimizes prompts, planning ceremonies, and workflow layers. Todoist lets you keep a straightforward list, while Sunsama assumes you’ll engage in a more guided daily planning process."

{
"q": "Is Sunsama too structured for a Minimalist?",
"a": "It can be if you dislike daily planning sessions or guided workflows. Its structure is helpful for some, but can feel heavy if you prefer a plain list."
},
{
"q": "Can I use Todoist in a minimalist way?",
"a": "Yes. You can keep a single list or rely on a simple daily view and ignore advanced features, maintaining a clean, uncluttered setup."
},
{
"q": "Will I miss out on productivity by avoiding structured rituals?",
"a": "Not necessarily. If you naturally review and prioritize your tasks, a simple list may be enough without adding formal planning sessions."
},
{
"q": "How do I know if structure is helping or hurting me?",
"a": "If a tool’s rituals make you more consistent and calm, they’re helping. If they feel like extra work before real work, they’re adding friction."
