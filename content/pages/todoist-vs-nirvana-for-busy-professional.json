"winner": "x",
"summary": "Todoist wins for busy professionals who need to log work tasks quickly between meetings. It lets you type a task into a single input field and move on without sorting it into a workflow first. Nirvana is built around a GTD flow that encourages clarifying and assigning contexts before processing tasks. If GTD-style workflow steps must be followed before task entry, Nirvana fails first.",

},
{
"q": "Which tool is better between meetings?",
"a": "Todoist is better for rapid capture because it does not require assigning contexts first."

{
"q": "Can Nirvana work without strict GTD use?",
"a": "Yes, but its structure is built around GTD concepts, so its interface reflects that workflow."
