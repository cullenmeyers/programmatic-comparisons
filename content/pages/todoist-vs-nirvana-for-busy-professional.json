"summary": "Todoist wins for busy professionals who need to log work tasks quickly without managing a GTD framework. It allows fast capture without forcing you through structured processing steps. Nirvana is built around GTD-style workflows, but if GTD-style workflow steps must be followed before task entry, it increases cognitive load and slows capture. Follow the rule: if GTD-style workflow steps must be followed before task entry, Nirvana fails first.",
