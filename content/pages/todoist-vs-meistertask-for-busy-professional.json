"summary": "Todoist wins for busy professionals who need to capture tasks quickly without navigating boards. Its list-first design reduces the number of clicks between idea and entry. MeisterTask relies on board-based organization, and if board-based organization must be managed before simple task entry, it slows capture and adds cognitive load. Follow the rule: if board-based organization must be managed before simple task entry, MeisterTask fails first.",
