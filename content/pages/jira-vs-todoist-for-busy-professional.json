"faqs": [
{
"q": "Can Jira be used for personal task lists?",
"a": "It can, but its issue based structure is designed for team workflows rather than quick personal capture."

"a": "For personal daily tasks, its simplicity is often an advantage when time is limited."
},
{
"q": "Which tool is faster to open and act on?",
"a": "Todoist is typically faster because it shows a consolidated list without requiring board navigation."
},
{
"q": "Does Jira require setup before use?",
"a": "Yes, you usually work inside predefined projects and workflows, which adds structure before logging tasks."
