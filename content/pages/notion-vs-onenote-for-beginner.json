"verdict": {
"winner": "y",
"summary": "OneNote wins for beginners replacing paper notes for the first time. It opens like a digital notebook where you click anywhere and start writing, similar to paper. Notion presents pages, blocks, and optional templates before you fully understand the structure. If blank-page complexity prevents immediate writing, Notion fails first.",

"point": "Templates for different page types",
"why_it_matters": "You can choose pre-built layouts for notes or projects. However, selecting a template before writing adds a decision step."

"faqs": [
{
"q": "Is Notion too complex for beginners?",
"a": "It can feel complex because it shows page types, blocks, and optional databases before you are used to digital notes."

{
"q": "Does OneNote work like a real notebook?",
"a": "Yes. It uses notebooks, sections, and pages that resemble physical organization."
},
{
"q": "Can I ignore advanced features in Notion?",
"a": "You can, but the structure of pages and blocks remains visible in the interface."
},
{
"q": "Which is easier for replacing paper notes?",
"a": "OneNote is usually easier because its layout feels closer to writing on paper."
