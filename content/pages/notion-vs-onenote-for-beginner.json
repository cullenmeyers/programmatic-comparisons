"persona": "Beginner",
"constraint_lens": "You have a low tolerance for setup and configuration, so the best tool is the one that lets you start writing immediately without designing a system.",
"verdict": {
"winner": "y",
"summary": "OneNote wins for beginners because it feels familiar and allows immediate writing with minimal decisions. Notion’s blank-page flexibility often creates uncertainty about structure before the first note is written. When replacing paper notes for the first time, OneNote lowers friction and helps habits form faster.",
"decision_rule": "If blank-page complexity prevents immediate writing, Notion fails first."

{
"q": "Is Notion too complex for beginners?",
"a": "Often yes, because it requires early decisions about structure that can slow down first-time users."

{
"q": "Why does OneNote feel easier than Notion?",
"a": "Because it mirrors traditional notebooks and minimizes setup before writing."
},
{
"q": "Can beginners switch from OneNote to Notion later?",
"a": "Yes. Starting simple builds the habit first, making future transitions easier."

{
"q": "What’s the biggest mistake beginners make with note apps?",
