"summary": "Craft wins for beginners who just want to start writing ideas immediately. It opens to a document-style page where you can click and type without arranging anything first. Milanote is built around boards and draggable cards, which means you must understand the layout before writing. If board-style layout must be understood before writing, Milanote fails first.",

"content": "You just want to type notes without learning visual board systems. As a beginner, extra layout decisions or setup screens slow you down. The best fit is the tool that behaves like a blank page the moment you open it. Anything that makes you arrange boards or cards before writing adds hesitation."

"bullets": [
{
"point": "Opens directly into a document-style page with a blinking cursor.",
"why_it_matters": "You can click and type immediately, so there are no layout choices to make before writing. If an app makes you choose a board or structure first, it slows your first idea."
},
{
"point": "Uses simple block editing inside a linear page.",
"why_it_matters": "Content flows top to bottom like a normal document, so you don’t have to drag or position items. This keeps your focus on writing instead of arranging elements."
},
{
"point": "Minimal upfront structure—no boards or canvases to set up.",
"why_it_matters": "You don’t need to understand a visual system before capturing ideas. If the first step is learning how the layout works, many beginners stop before they start."

{

},
{
"point": "Supports columns and visual grouping on a board.",
"why_it_matters": "This helps when organizing complex ideas visually. However, deciding where each note belongs can interrupt quick idea capture."
},
{
"point": "Designed around visual planning rather than linear writing.",
"why_it_matters": "If you think in diagrams, this can feel natural. For someone who just wants to type text, the visual layout becomes an extra step before writing."

"faqs": [
{
"q": "Is Craft easier to start using than Milanote?",
"a": "For beginners who just want to type, yes. Craft opens like a document, while Milanote requires understanding how boards and cards work first."
},
{
"q": "Does Milanote require setup before writing?",
"a": "You typically create or enter a board and add cards to it, which introduces layout decisions before you simply start typing."
},
{
"q": "Can beginners still use Milanote successfully?",
"a": "Yes, especially if they prefer visual planning. The challenge is that the board system adds extra decisions before writing."
},
{
"q": "Which tool is better for fast idea capture?",
"a": "Craft is better if your goal is to open the app and immediately type ideas without arranging elements on a canvas."
