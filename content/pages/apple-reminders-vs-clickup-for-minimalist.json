"summary": "Apple Reminders wins for minimalists who want the simplest possible task list. It focuses on straightforward lists without dashboards, layered views, or configuration panels. ClickUp is powerful, but if multiple views and configuration panels add extra decisions, it creates friction instead of clarity.
