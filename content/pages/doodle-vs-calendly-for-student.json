"winner": "x",
"summary": "Doodle wins for students coordinating availability for a short term group project. It lets you create a poll with time options and send a link without building a booking page or workflow.

"faqs": [
{
"q": "Can I use Calendly for group scheduling?",
"a": "You can share one booking link, but it does not show a voting table of everyone availability like a poll does."
},
{
"q": "Does Doodle require everyone to create accounts?",
"a": "Participants can usually respond through the poll link, which keeps it lightweight for short term coordination."
},
{
"q": "Which is faster for a single project?",
"a": "Doodle is typically faster because you only create a poll and send it, without building a reusable booking system."
},
{
"q": "Will I need to keep using Doodle after the project?",
"a": "No, you can run one poll, finalize a meeting time, and stop without maintaining event types or public scheduling pages."
