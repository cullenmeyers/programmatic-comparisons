"summary": "Doodle is the better fit for a student coordinating group availability for a short-term project. It allows you to poll multiple time options without setting up individual booking links. If booking pages and event types must be configured before simply collecting availability, Calendly adds unnecessary friction.",

With short-term use and low switching cost as priorities, the tool should require minimal setup and no long-term structure. Doodle focuses on fast availability polling, while Calendly is designed around individual booking flows."
