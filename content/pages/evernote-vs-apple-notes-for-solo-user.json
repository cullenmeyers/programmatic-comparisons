"summary": "Apple Notes wins for solo users who want long-term storage without ongoing upkeep. It syncs automatically through your Apple ID and does not surface plan tiers during normal use. Evernote includes subscription levels, device limits, and visible usage rules that can require periodic decisions. If the tool requires plan decisions or periodic cleanups, Evernote fails first.",

"content": "You keep personal notes for years and do not want to manage them like a project. Apple Notes relies on simple folders and search, which stay usable even if you ignore organization for months. Evernote encourages tagging systems, notebook stacks, and awareness of plan limits that may need attention over time."
