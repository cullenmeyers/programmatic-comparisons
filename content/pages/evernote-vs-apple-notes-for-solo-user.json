"summary": "Apple Notes wins for solo users because it quietly stores notes long term without demanding upkeep. Evernote offers more power, but that power comes with periodic decisions, reviews, and cleanup that violate a zero-maintenance preference. When notes are meant to sit safely for years, Apple Notes stays out of the way.",
