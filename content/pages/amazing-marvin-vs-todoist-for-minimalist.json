"persona": "Minimalist",
"constraint_lens": "You are averse to features, so the best task manager is the one that avoids modes, experiments, and customization in favor of simple lists.",
"verdict": {
"winner": "y",
"summary": "Todoist wins for minimalists because it keeps task tracking straightforward and opinionated. Amazing Marvin is flexible by design, but its many modes and options invite experimentation that distracts from doing. When simplicity and calm matter most, Todoist stays focused on tasks.",
"decision_rule": "If the tool offers too many modes or options, Amazing Marvin fails first."

{
"q": "Is Amazing Marvin too complex for minimalists?",
"a": "Often yes, because its many modes and options invite ongoing experimentation."
},
{
"q": "Why does Todoist feel calmer?",
"a": "Because it limits customization and keeps the focus on tasks."
},
{
"q": "Can a minimalist still use Amazing Marvin?",
"a": "Only with strong restraint. For most minimalists, the flexibility undermines simplicity."
},
{
"q": "What’s the biggest risk of ultra-flexible task tools?",
"a": "That optimizing the system replaces doing the work."
