"verdict": {
"winner": "y",
"summary": "Bear wins for minimalists because it keeps the experience centered on writing without visual decisions. Milanote’s open canvas and visual freedom introduce choices that compete with focus. When the goal is calm, clean note writing, Bear aligns better with feature aversion.",
