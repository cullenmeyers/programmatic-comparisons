"verdict": {
"winner": "y",
"summary": "Things 3 wins for busy professionals because it supports execution without demanding ongoing system management. OmniFocus is powerful, but maintaining its structure can consume the same thinking time the tasks were meant to save. When work is intense and attention is limited, Things 3 keeps the focus on doing.",

{
"q": "Is OmniFocus too heavy for busy professionals?",
"a": "Often yes, because its power requires ongoing attention that competes with real work."
},
{
"q": "Why does Things 3 feel easier to maintain?",
"a": "Because it limits concepts and keeps the task model simple."
},
{
"q": "Can I use OmniFocus for planning and Things 3 for doing?",
"a": "Yes. Some users separate planning from execution to reduce daily cognitive load."
},
{
"q": "What’s the biggest risk of complex task systems when busy?",
"a": "That managing the system consumes the time it was meant to save."
