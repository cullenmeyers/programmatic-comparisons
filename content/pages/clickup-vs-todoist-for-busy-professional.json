"persona": "Busy professional",
"constraint_lens": "You face time scarcity and cognitive overload, so any tool that demands planning, setup, or system thinking instead of execution slows you down.",
"verdict": {
"winner": "y",
"summary": "Todoist wins for busy professionals because it prioritizes execution over planning. ClickUp is powerful, but its interface often pulls users into configuration and system decisions that drain limited mental energy. When the goal is to keep work moving between meetings, Todoist keeps friction low.",
"decision_rule": "If the interface demands planning instead of execution, ClickUp fails first."

"point": "You’re comfortable maintaining a system over time",
"why_it_matters": "ClickUp works best when someone actively curates the setup. For low-energy moments, that upkeep becomes a burden."

"point": "The system stays lightweight over time",
