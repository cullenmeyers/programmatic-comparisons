"summary": "Google Docs wins for students who only need collaborative notes for one term. You can create a document, share a link, and start typing together immediately.

{
"q": "Is Google Docs better for group notes?",
"a": "Yes, for quick collaboration. You can share a link and edit together without building a workspace first."

{
"q": "Does Notion require database setup?",
"a": "Not always, but many useful setups involve creating tables or structured pages, which can add extra steps."
},
{
"q": "Which tool is easier to stop using after the term ends?",
"a": "Google Docs is easier to leave because your notes exist as standalone documents that can be exported easily."
},
{
"q": "Can Notion handle simple shared notes?",
"a": "Yes, but its design encourages building connected pages and databases, which may be more than needed for one term."
