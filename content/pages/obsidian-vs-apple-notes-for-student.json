"meta_description": "A practical comparison of Obsidian vs Apple Notes for students who need to organize class notes for a single semester with minimal setup.",
"persona": "Student",
"constraint_lens": "You only need notes for a short period and want a low switching cost, so any setup that doesn’t pay off within a semester is wasted effort.",
"verdict": {
"winner": "y",
"summary": "Apple Notes wins for students because it delivers immediate usefulness with almost no upfront investment. Obsidian can become powerful over time, but its setup and learning curve rarely pay back within a single semester. When short-term utility matters more than long-term systems, Apple Notes is the safer choice.",
"decision_rule": "If the setup cost outweighs the semester length, Obsidian fails first."

{
"type": "persona_fit",
"heading": "What a student actually needs for a single semester",
"content": "For a student, notes are a temporary support system tied to classes, deadlines, and exams. The best tool is the one that helps you stay organized immediately and can be abandoned without regret once the semester ends."

"point": "You plan to reuse the notes beyond this semester",
"why_it_matters": "Obsidian’s value compounds over time. If the notes won’t survive past finals week, the setup effort rarely earns a return."
},
{
"point": "You already know how you want to structure your notes",
"why_it_matters": "Clear structure reduces setup cost. Without it, time spent organizing competes directly with studying."
},
{
"point": "You enjoy building a system as part of learning",
"why_it_matters": "If system-building itself motivates you, Obsidian can feel rewarding. For most students, it’s a distraction from coursework."

"point": "It’s useful from day one",
"why_it_matters": "Classes move fast. Apple Notes lets you organize notes immediately without spending early weeks setting things up."
},
{
"point": "Abandoning the tool later has no penalty",
"why_it_matters": "At the end of the semester, you can stop using it without feeling like you wasted time building a system."
},
{
"point": "Organization stays simple and sufficient",
"why_it_matters": "Folders and search are enough for short-term academic use, avoiding over-optimization for a temporary need."

"faqs": [
{
"q": "Is Obsidian overkill for most students?",
"a": "For short-term use, yes. Its strengths usually require more time than a single semester allows."
},
{
"q": "Why is low switching cost important for students?",
"a": "Because academic needs change every term, and investing heavily in one system can become wasted effort."
},
{
"q": "Can I move notes from Apple Notes later?",
"a": "Yes. Apple Notes keeps things simple, making it easy to export or leave behind when the semester ends."
},
{
"q": "What’s the biggest mistake students make with note apps?",
"a": "Optimizing for a long-term system when their actual need is short-term performance."
