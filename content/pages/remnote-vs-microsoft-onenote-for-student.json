"summary": "Microsoft OneNote wins for students who need to organize class material for one semester without learning a study framework. It supports straightforward note organization without forcing a methodology. RemNote is built around spaced repetition and structured learning, but if spaced repetition structures must be understood before basic note-taking, it adds overhead that isn’t justified for short-term use. Follow the rule: if spaced repetition structures must be understood before basic note-taking, RemNote fails first.",

"faqs": [
{
"q": "Which tool is easier for short-term academic notes?",
"a": "Microsoft OneNote is generally easier because it doesn’t require learning a study framework before writing notes."

{
"q": "Is RemNote too structured for one semester?",
"a": "It can be if spaced repetition and concept structures feel heavier than your immediate coursework needs."
},
{
"q": "What does low switching cost mean here?",
"a": "It means you can stop using the app after the term without leaving behind a complex study system."
},
{
"q": "When would RemNote be the better choice?",
"a": "If you want integrated flashcards and long-term memory reinforcement built directly into your notes."
