RemNote centers around spaced repetition and linked note structures that require understanding its framework.

"faqs": [
{
"q": "Is RemNote only for long-term studying?",
"a": "It’s designed around spaced repetition and linked concepts, which makes it especially useful for long-term retention rather than short-term note organization."
},
{
"q": "Can I just use RemNote for plain notes?",
"a": "Yes, but its core features revolve around flashcards and review queues, which may feel unnecessary for a single semester."
},
{
"q": "Is Microsoft OneNote good for organizing multiple classes?",
"a": "Yes. Its notebook and section system makes it easy to separate subjects without learning special rules."
},
{
"q": "Which tool is easier to stop using after the semester ends?",
"a": "Microsoft OneNote is easier to leave because it doesn’t tie your notes into a structured review system."
