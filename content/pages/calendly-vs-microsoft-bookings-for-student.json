"verdict": {
"winner": "x",
"summary": "Calendly is the better choice for a student who needs temporary scheduling links for a semester project. Microsoft Bookings often assumes a more formal or enterprise-style setup. If configuration and account structure take longer than the semester requires, Calendly keeps things lightweight and easy to switch away from.",

"content": "You only need scheduling links for a limited period, not a long-term system. With short-term use and low switching cost as priorities, speed matters more than deep configuration. Calendly lets you create a link quickly and move on, while Microsoft Bookings may involve more setup than a semester project justifies."

{
"q": "Which tool is easier to set up quickly?",
"a": "Calendly is typically faster for creating a simple scheduling link without extensive configuration."
},
{
"q": "Is Microsoft Bookings overkill for a semester project?",
"a": "It can be if you only need temporary scheduling. Its structure makes more sense for ongoing or institutional use."
},
{
"q": "Can I switch tools mid-semester if needed?",
"a": "Yes. For short-term academic use, it’s common to switch if your needs change, especially if you started with a lightweight setup."
},
{
"q": "What matters most for student scheduling tools?",
"a": "Speed of setup, ease of sharing links, and the ability to stop using the tool without long-term commitments."
