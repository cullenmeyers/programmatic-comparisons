"winner": "x",
"summary": "Calendly wins for students who need temporary scheduling links for a semester project. You can create one event type, set availability, and share a link in minutes. Microsoft Bookings is structured around services and staff inside Microsoft 365, which can take longer to configure. If enterprise setup takes longer than the semester requires, Microsoft Bookings fails first.",

"faqs": [
{
"q": "Is Microsoft Bookings too heavy for students?",
"a": "It can feel heavier because it centers around services and staff roles inside Microsoft 365 rather than quick single event links."
},
{
"q": "Can I create multiple event types in Calendly?",
"a": "Yes, but you can also keep it simple with just one event type for your semester project."
},
{
"q": "Which one is easier to stop using after the project?",
"a": "Calendly is usually easier to abandon because you are not required to maintain a structured organization setup."
},
{
"q": "Do both tools sync with calendars?",
"a": "Yes, both connect to calendar accounts so confirmed bookings appear automatically."
