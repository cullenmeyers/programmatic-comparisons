{
"q": "Which app is faster to start with for class notes?",
"a": "Google Keep is typically faster because it allows immediate note capture without creating notebooks or sections."

"a": "It can be if your notes are simple and you don’t need layered organization."

{
"q": "What matters most for student note apps?",
"a": "Quick setup, simplicity, and the ability to stop using the tool without long-term maintenance are key."
