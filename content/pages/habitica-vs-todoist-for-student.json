"summary": "Todoist wins for students who need a temporary task list for a semester. It lets you track assignments without committing to a layered system. Habitica adds game mechanics that can be motivating, but if game mechanics introduce overhead beyond semester needs, they increase switching cost and complexity.

"faqs": [
{
"q": "Which tool is easier to use for just one semester?",
"a": "Todoist is typically easier because it doesn’t require managing gamified systems or long-term progress mechanics."
},
{
"q": "Can gamification help students?",
"a": "Yes, but only if the added layers increase motivation more than they increase management overhead."
},
{
"q": "What does low switching cost mean for students?",
"a": "It means you can stop using the app after the term without cleanup, restructuring, or feeling tied to accumulated progress."
},
{
"q": "Is Habitica too complex for short-term use?",
"a": "It can be if the game elements require ongoing attention beyond what’s necessary to track assignments."
