"summary": "Amplenote wins for busy professionals who want tasks tied directly to notes without extra setup. It includes built-in task management with due dates and priority views inside the same app. Obsidian can handle tasks, but often requires installing and configuring community plugins to match that workflow. If task integration requires installing and configuring community plugins before it works smoothly, Obsidian fails first.",
