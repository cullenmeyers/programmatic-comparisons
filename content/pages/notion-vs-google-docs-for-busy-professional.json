"verdict": {
"winner": "y",
"summary": "Google Docs wins for busy professionals who need to capture ideas quickly between meetings. It opens to a blank document where you can start typing immediately without choosing page types or layouts. Notion often asks you to pick a page format or shows blocks and templates before you write. If the tool asks for structure before content, Notion fails first.",

{
"type": "persona_fit",
"heading": "Best fit when time is tight",
"content": "You write quick notes, not systems or databases. Google Docs matches that behavior because it starts as a plain document with no layout decisions required. Notion is designed around pages, blocks, and optional databases, which can slow you down when you only want to jot an idea."

"heading": "Where Notion wins",
"bullets": [
{
"point": "Block-based editor with slash commands for inserting content",
"why_it_matters": "You can type slash to add tables, toggles, or embeds inside a page. This is powerful for structured work, but seeing these options can add mental steps when you just want to type fast."
},
{
"point": "Database views like table, board, and calendar",
"why_it_matters": "You can turn notes into sortable lists or kanban boards. This helps when managing projects, yet choosing a database type takes extra time during quick capture."
},
{
"point": "Custom templates inside a workspace",
"why_it_matters": "You can pre-build note layouts for recurring tasks. However, selecting or editing templates adds setup moments that interrupt rapid idea capture."

"type": "y_wins",
"heading": "Where Google Docs wins",
"bullets": [
{
"point": "Immediate blank document on creation",
"why_it_matters": "You click new document and start typing with no layout choice. This removes decisions when your schedule is packed."
},
{
"point": "Minimal interface focused on text editing",
"why_it_matters": "The top toolbar stays consistent and does not change based on page type. This predictability lowers mental load during quick note sessions."
},
{
"point": "Fast sharing through link permissions",
"why_it_matters": "You can send a link and set view or edit access in seconds. This avoids extra setup when you need to forward notes right after a meeting."

"faqs": [
{
"q": "Is Notion slower for quick notes?",
"a": "It can feel slower because new pages often show templates, blocks, or database options before you start typing."
},
{
"q": "Does Google Docs support structured content?",
"a": "It supports headings, tables, and comments, but it does not include database-style views like boards or filtered tables."
},
{
"q": "Can I use both together?",
"a": "Yes. Many professionals capture ideas in Docs and later move long-term projects into Notion."
},
{
"q": "Which is better for daily idea capture?",
"a": "For pure speed and minimal decisions, Google Docs is usually the faster starting point."
