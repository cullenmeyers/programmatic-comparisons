"verdict": {

"summary": "Google Docs wins for busy professionals because it allows immediate writing with no upfront decisions. Notion’s flexibility introduces questions about structure that compete with limited mental bandwidth. When the goal is fast idea capture, Google Docs stays out of the way.",

"faqs": [
{
"q": "Is Notion too slow for busy professionals?",
"a": "Often yes, because it introduces structural decisions that compete with limited attention."
},
{
"q": "Why does Google Docs feel faster?",
"a": "Because it removes setup and lets writing begin immediately."
},
{
"q": "Can I still organize notes later in Google Docs?",
"a": "Yes. You can clean up or move notes later without paying that cost at capture time."
},
{
"q": "What’s the biggest risk of complex tools when busy?",
"a": "That capturing ideas becomes another task instead of instant relief."
