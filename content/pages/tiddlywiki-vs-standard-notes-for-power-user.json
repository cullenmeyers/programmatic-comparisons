"summary": "TiddlyWiki wins for power users who want a self-contained and deeply customizable knowledge archive. It runs as a single HTML file that stores content, structure, and custom behavior together. Standard Notes supports extensions, but customization is constrained by its editor and extension model.

{
"q": "Is TiddlyWiki really portable?",
"a": "Yes. It can run as a single HTML file containing notes and custom logic."
},
{
"q": "Can Standard Notes be customized?",
"a": "Yes, through extensions, but changes remain within the extension framework."
},
{
"q": "Which has the higher ceiling for customization?",
"a": "TiddlyWiki generally has the higher ceiling because you can modify its structure directly."
},
{
"q": "Which is easier to sync across devices?",
"a": "Standard Notes is easier because it handles sync through its account system."
