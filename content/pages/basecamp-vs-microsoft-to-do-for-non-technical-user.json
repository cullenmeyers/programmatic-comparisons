"summary": "Microsoft To Do wins for non-technical users who want straightforward task tracking without communication layers. It keeps the experience focused on simple lists, reducing the fear of clicking the wrong thing. Basecamp is built around projects, message boards, and shared spaces, but if message boards and project layers feel risky or confusing, it adds unnecessary anxiety. Follow the rule: if message boards and project layers feel risky or confusing, Basecamp fails first.",
