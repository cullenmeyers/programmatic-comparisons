"summary": "Google Keep wins for busy professionals with very little mental bandwidth between meetings. It opens to a quick note field and saves instantly without asking how ideas relate. Roam Research centers on blocks, backlinks, and linked pages that invite structural thinking. If note-taking requires deciding how to link or structure ideas, Roam fails first.",

"faqs": [
{
"q": "Is Roam too complex for quick capture?",
"a": "It can be, because its block and linking system encourages structural thinking."
},
{
"q": "Does Google Keep support long notes?",
"a": "Yes, but it is optimized for short, fast entries rather than complex structures."
},
{
"q": "Can I ignore backlinks in Roam?",
"a": "You can, but the interface still highlights blocks and linking behavior."
},
{
"q": "Which is better between meetings?",
"a": "Google Keep is usually better because it minimizes decisions during capture."
