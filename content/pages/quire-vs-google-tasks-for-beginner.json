"winner": "y",
"summary": "Google Tasks wins for beginners because it allows immediate task entry without requiring knowledge of nested structures. Quire’s hierarchy and subtask model can feel powerful, but it assumes understanding before value appears. When the goal is simply to track tasks, Google Tasks keeps things obvious.",
