"summary": "Google Tasks wins for beginners who just want to track simple tasks. You can open a list and start typing without thinking about parent tasks or project trees.

"q": "Is Quire difficult for beginners?",

"q": "Can Google Tasks handle recurring tasks?",
"a": "Yes, you can set tasks to repeat without building project hierarchies."
},
{
"q": "Which tool is faster to start using?",
"a": "Google Tasks is typically faster because you can add items directly into a simple list."
},
{
"q": "Does Quire require projects before adding tasks?",
"a": "Tasks are usually created inside projects, which adds a layer before organizing work."
