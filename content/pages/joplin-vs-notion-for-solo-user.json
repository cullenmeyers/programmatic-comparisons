"winner": "x",
"summary": "Joplin wins for solo users who want a long-term archive without ongoing restructuring. It stores notes in a simple notebook and markdown format that rarely needs redesign.

The right tool should feel stable and predictable year after year. Anything that pushes you to rebuild tables or layouts becomes ongoing work."

{
"q": "Which tool is lower maintenance?",
"a": "Joplin is lower maintenance because it avoids database schemas and dashboard redesign."
