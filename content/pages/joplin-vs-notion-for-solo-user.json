"faqs": [
{
"q": "Which tool requires less long-term maintenance?",
"a": "Joplin generally requires less maintenance because it relies on simple notebook structure rather than evolving databases."
},
{
"q": "Why might Notion require restructuring?",
"a": "As databases grow, you may adjust properties, views, and relationships to keep the system organized."
},
{
"q": "Is flexibility always better for solo users?",
"a": "Not necessarily. Flexibility can lead to ongoing redesign if you prefer a stable, low-maintenance archive."
},
{
"q": "When would Notion be the better choice?",
"a": "If you actively want to build and refine a customizable knowledge system over time."
