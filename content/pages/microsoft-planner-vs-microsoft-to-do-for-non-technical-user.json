"verdict": {
"winner": "y",
"summary": "Microsoft To Do wins for non-technical users because it treats tasks as simple, flexible lists. Microsoft Planner introduces buckets, plans, and structure that can feel formal or easy to misuse. When confidence and simplicity matter most, Microsoft To Do feels safer and more forgiving.",
