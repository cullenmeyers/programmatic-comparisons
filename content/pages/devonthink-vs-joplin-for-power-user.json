"persona": "Power user",
"constraint_lens": "You need a research system that scales in indexing depth, automation rules, and database control without hitting limits.",
"verdict": {
"winner": "x",
"summary": "DEVONthink wins for power users managing large research archives. It provides deep indexing, rule-based automation, and smart groups that operate at the database level. Joplin supports notebooks and plugins, but its indexing and automation are more limited. If database indexing and rule-based automation are constrained, Joplin fails first.",

{
"type": "persona_fit",
"heading": "Best fit for massive research control",
"content": "You maintain a large research archive and expect fine control over how content is indexed and organized. DEVONthink operates as a database with built-in indexing, smart rules, and classification tools. Joplin centers on Markdown notes inside notebooks with lighter automation features."

"why_it_matters": "You can define rules that move or tag documents automatically. This reduces manual sorting in a large archive."

"faqs": [
{
"q": "Is DEVONthink better for research archives?",
"a": "Yes. It supports deep indexing and rule-based automation suited for large databases."
},
{
"q": "Can Joplin handle large note collections?",
"a": "It can handle many notes, but lacks advanced database-style automation."
},
{
"q": "Does Joplin support plugins?",
"a": "Yes, but plugin capabilities do not replace full database-level indexing."
},
{
"q": "Which has the higher ceiling for research management?",
"a": "DEVONthink generally has the higher ceiling due to its indexing and rule engine."
