"summary": "Obsidian is the better fit for a Power user building a long-term second brain. Apple Notes works well for straightforward capture, but it constrains graph linking and deep extensibility. If advanced linking and plugin-based expansion are limited, Apple Notes hits its ceiling first.",

"faqs": [
{
"q": "Which tool scales better over time?",
"a": "Obsidian scales better for complex knowledge systems because of its linking structure and plugin ecosystem."
},
{
"q": "Is Apple Notes too limited for power users?",
"a": "It can be if you require deep linking, extensibility, and system-level customization."
},
{
"q": "Can I start with Apple Notes and switch later?",
"a": "Yes, but migrating a large knowledge base can be time-consuming once your system grows."
},
{
"q": "What matters most for building a second brain?",
"a": "Long-term flexibility, strong linking between ideas, and the ability to extend functionality as your needs expand."
