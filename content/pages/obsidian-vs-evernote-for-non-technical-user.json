"meta_description": "A clear comparison of Obsidian vs Evernote for non-technical users who want safe, accessible notes without worrying about files, folders, or breaking things.",
"persona": "Non-technical user",
"constraint_lens": "You have a fear of breaking things, so the best tool is the one that feels managed, stable, and hard to mess up by accident.",
"verdict": {
"winner": "y",
"summary": "Evernote wins for non-technical users because it removes exposure to files, plugins, and system-level decisions. Obsidian offers flexibility, but that flexibility comes with visible mechanics that can trigger fear of doing something wrong. When reliability and peace of mind matter most, Evernote feels safer and more hands-off.",
"decision_rule": "If the user worries about managing local files or plugins, Obsidian fails first."

"heading": "What a non-technical user needs to keep notes safe",
"content": "For a non-technical user, confidence matters more than control. The right note tool should feel stable, predictable, and protected from accidental mistakes, with as little exposure as possible to how syncing or storage actually works."

{
"type": "x_wins",
"heading": "When Obsidian can work despite fear of breaking things",
"bullets": [
{
"point": "You trust local storage and never touch settings or plugins",
"why_it_matters": "Obsidian is safest when treated as a simple writing app. The moment you feel pressure to manage files or extensions, anxiety increases and the tool becomes harder to trust."
},
{
"point": "You value having full ownership of your notes over convenience",
"why_it_matters": "Knowing your notes live as plain files can be reassuring for some users. For others, that visibility creates worry about accidental deletion or misplacement."
},
{
"point": "You have a single-device workflow with minimal syncing needs",
"why_it_matters": "Obsidian feels simpler when syncing isn’t a concern. Once multiple devices enter the picture, perceived risk rises for non-technical users."

"heading": "Why Evernote wins for non-technical users",
"bullets": [
{
"point": "Storage and syncing are invisible",
"why_it_matters": "Evernote hides the mechanics, reducing fear of accidental loss. Notes feel like they’re just “there,” which builds trust over time."
},
{
"point": "The system feels managed rather than configurable",
"why_it_matters": "A managed environment lowers anxiety. You’re less likely to feel responsible for breaking something you didn’t have to set up."
},
{
"point": "Consistency across devices is automatic",
"why_it_matters": "Non-technical users want reassurance that notes will appear everywhere without intervention. Evernote delivers that confidence without extra decisions."

},
{
"tool": "y",
"fails_when": "The user wants deep customization or control and feels limited by a managed system.",
"what_to_do_instead": "Accept the trade-off for safety, or only explore more flexible tools once confidence and technical comfort increase."

"faqs": [
{
"q": "Is Obsidian risky for non-technical users?",
"a": "It isn’t inherently risky, but it exposes storage and configuration details that can create anxiety for users who fear breaking things."
},
{
"q": "Why does Evernote feel safer?",
"a": "Because it abstracts away files, syncing, and system decisions, making it harder to accidentally misconfigure or lose notes."
},
{
"q": "Can a non-technical user grow into Obsidian later?",
"a": "Yes. Once confidence increases and the desire for control outweighs fear, Obsidian can become appealing—but it’s rarely the best starting point."
},
{
"q": "What’s the biggest mistake non-technical users make with note apps?",
"a": "Choosing flexibility too early, which increases anxiety and reduces trust in the system instead of supporting consistent use."
