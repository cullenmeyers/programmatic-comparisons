"summary": "Evernote wins for non-technical users who want reliable, accessible notes without thinking about how they are stored. It handles syncing through its account system and keeps files hidden behind the app. Obsidian centers on local folders, vaults, and optional plugins that require more hands-on setup. If the user worries about managing local files or plugins, Obsidian fails first.",
