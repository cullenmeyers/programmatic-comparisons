"constraint_lens": "You are averse to features and systems, so the best tool is the one that lets you write without encouraging setup, structure, or optimization.",
"verdict": {
"winner": "y",
"summary": "Apple Notes wins for minimalists because it keeps note-taking simple and avoids pulling you into system-building. Obsidian is powerful, but its emphasis on structure and workflows introduces decisions that distract from writing. When calm, system-free notes matter most, Apple Notes stays out of the way.",

"point": "You already have a fixed, simple workflow",
"why_it_matters": "If the system is decided once and never revisited, Obsidian’s flexibility won’t constantly demand attention."

{
"point": "Writing is the default, not a choice",
"why_it_matters": "Apple Notes opens directly to writing, which aligns with a minimalist desire to avoid decisions."
},
{
"point": "There is no visible system to manage",
"why_it_matters": "Folders and search stay in the background, preventing the urge to tweak or optimize."

{
"point": "The app discourages overthinking",

"faqs": [
{
"q": "Is Obsidian too complex for minimalists?",
"a": "Often yes, because it naturally encourages system-building, which conflicts with feature aversion."
},
{
"q": "Why does Apple Notes feel simpler?",
"a": "Because it limits customization and keeps organization largely invisible."
},
{
"q": "Can a minimalist still use Obsidian?",
"a": "Only with strict self-restraint. For most minimalists, that effort defeats the purpose."
},
{
"q": "What’s the biggest risk of system-heavy note apps?",
"a": "That managing the system replaces the act of writing."
