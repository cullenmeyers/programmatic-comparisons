"verdict": {
"winner": "y",
"summary": "Apple Notes wins for minimalists who want simple personal notes without system overhead. It uses folders and tags that stay in the background while you write. Obsidian is built around vaults, plugins, backlinks, and file structure that encourage system-building. If the tool encourages system-building over writing, Obsidian fails first.",

"faqs": [
{
"q": "Is Obsidian too complex for minimalists?",
"a": "It can feel complex because it highlights linking, vaults, and plugins even if you do not use them."

{
"q": "Does Apple Notes require setup?",
"a": "For most users, it works through the existing Apple account with little additional configuration."
},
{
"q": "Can Obsidian be used as a simple editor?",
"a": "Yes, but its system-oriented features remain visible in the interface."
},
{
"q": "Which feels lighter for daily personal notes?",
"a": "Apple Notes generally feels lighter because it avoids system-building cues."
