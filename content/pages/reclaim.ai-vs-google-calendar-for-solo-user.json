"summary": "Google Calendar wins for solo users who want their schedule to stay stable without ongoing tuning. It shows fixed events exactly where you place them, with no auto reshuffling rules running in the background.

"faqs": [
{
"q": "Does Reclaim.ai replace Google Calendar?",
"a": "It connects to Google Calendar and adds automatic scheduling on top, which means you are adding another layer rather than replacing your base calendar."
},
{
"q": "Is Google Calendar too basic for solo planning?",
"a": "It is simpler, but that simplicity means fewer moving parts and no ongoing rule adjustments."
},
{
"q": "Will Reclaim.ai constantly move my events?",
"a": "It can move flexible tasks and habits based on priority settings, which may require occasional tuning to match your preferences."
},
{
"q": "Which one requires less ongoing effort?",
"a": "Google Calendar usually requires less ongoing effort because it does not run automatic rescheduling rules in the background."
