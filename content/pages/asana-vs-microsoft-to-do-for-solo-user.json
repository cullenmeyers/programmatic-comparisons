"persona": "Solo user",
"constraint_lens": "You have zero tolerance for ongoing maintenance, so the best tool is the one that stays usable without regular status updates or structural changes.",
"verdict": {
"winner": "y",
"summary": "Microsoft To Do wins for solo users because it remains simple and stable without requiring upkeep. Asana is designed around projects and statuses that tend to decay unless they are actively maintained. When you want tasks to quietly support your life instead of becoming another responsibility, Microsoft To Do fits better.",
"decision_rule": "If projects require constant status or structure updates, Asana fails first."

"point": "You actively manage structured personal projects",

},
{
"point": "You like tracking progress with statuses",
"why_it_matters": "Statuses add meaning only if they’re kept current, which adds ongoing effort."
},
{
"point": "You treat task management as a system to maintain",
"why_it_matters": "Asana assumes someone is tending the system. For hands-off users, that assumption breaks down."

},
{
"point": "Tasks stay readable without updates",
"why_it_matters": "You can return after a break and still understand what needs to be done."
},
{
"point": "There is nothing to maintain",

{
"q": "What’s the biggest risk of project-based tools for solo users?",
