"summary": "Todoist wins for minimalists who want a clean checklist without visual boards or extra views. It centers on simple lists and quick task entry. MeisterTask’s board-based layout can be useful, but if board-based organization introduces unnecessary interaction steps, it adds friction instead of clarity. Follow the rule: if board-based organization introduces unnecessary interaction steps, MeisterTask fails first.",

"faqs": [
{
"q": "Which tool is simpler for daily to-dos?",
"a": "Todoist is typically simpler because it focuses on straightforward lists rather than board-based organization."
},
{
"q": "Is MeisterTask too complex for minimalists?",
"a": "It can be if visual boards and column movement add interaction steps you don’t need."
},
{
"q": "When would a board-based tool be better?",
"a": "If your tasks move through clear stages and you benefit from visual progress tracking, boards can help."
},
{
"q": "What’s the main tradeoff here?",
"a": "MeisterTask emphasizes visual workflow, while Todoist emphasizes lightweight checklist simplicity."
