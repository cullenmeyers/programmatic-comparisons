"faqs": [
{
"q": "Is Obsidian slow to open?",
"a": "It can take longer than lightweight apps because it loads a vault and plugins before you begin writing."
},
{
"q": "Does Google Keep support long notes?",
"a": "Yes, but it is optimized for short, quick entries rather than large linked documents."
},
{
"q": "Can Obsidian be used for quick capture?",
"a": "Yes, especially with daily notes, but it still centers around a file-based structure."
},
{
"q": "Which is better between meetings?",
"a": "Google Keep is generally faster because it requires fewer steps before typing."
