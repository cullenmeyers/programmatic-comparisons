"persona": "Busy professional",
"constraint_lens": "You face time scarcity and cognitive overload, so any extra step or decision during capture creates friction and causes lost ideas.",
"verdict": {
"winner": "y",
"summary": "Google Keep wins for busy professionals because it enables near-instant capture with minimal thinking. Obsidian’s flexibility introduces decisions and context switching that slow down fleeting thought capture. When seconds matter and mental bandwidth is scarce, Google Keep preserves momentum.",

"point": "Your notes feed directly into a long-term system",
"why_it_matters": "If capture is immediately processed later, the overhead may be justified. For fleeting thoughts, it usually isn’t."

{
"q": "Is Obsidian too slow for busy professionals?",
"a": "Often yes, because its flexibility introduces decisions that compete with limited mental bandwidth."

"q": "Why does Google Keep feel faster?",
"a": "Because it minimizes taps and decisions at the moment of capture."
},
{
"q": "Can I use both tools together?",
"a": "Yes. Use Google Keep for fast capture and Obsidian later for deliberate organization."
},
{
"q": "What’s the biggest risk with complex tools when busy?",
"a": "That capturing thoughts becomes another task instead of instant relief."
