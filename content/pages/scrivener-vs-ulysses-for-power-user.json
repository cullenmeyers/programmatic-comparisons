{
"q": "Does Scrivener support complex document structures?",
"a": "Yes. Its binder allows deep nesting of folders and documents."
},
{
"q": "Is Ulysses easier to use?",
"a": "It is simpler and cleaner, but offers less granular control over structure."
},
{
"q": "Which handles export customization better?",
"a": "Scrivener provides more detailed compile and export options."
},
{
"q": "Which has the higher ceiling for long research projects?",
"a": "Scrivener generally has the higher ceiling due to its structural and compilation control."
