"summary": "Apple Reminders wins for minimalists who just want a plain checklist. It focuses on simple lists without formal productivity frameworks layered on top. FacileThings is built around GTD-style workflows, but if GTD-style workflows introduce extra interaction steps, it adds friction for someone who wants straightforward daily to-dos.
