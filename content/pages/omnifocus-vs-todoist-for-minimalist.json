"constraint_lens": "You are averse to features, so the best task manager is the one that avoids frameworks, terminology, and setup in favor of simple checklists.",
"verdict": {
"winner": "y",
"summary": "Todoist wins for minimalists because it keeps task tracking straightforward and avoids imposing a methodology. OmniFocus is powerful, but its frameworks and concepts introduce mental overhead that works against simplicity. When fewer ideas about how to work lead to better follow-through, Todoist fits better.",

{
"q": "Is OmniFocus too complex for minimalists?",
"a": "Often yes, because it introduces frameworks and terminology that add mental overhead."
},
{
"q": "Why does Todoist feel simpler?",
"a": "Because it focuses on adding and completing tasks without requiring a specific way of working."
},
{
"q": "Can a minimalist still use OmniFocus?",
"a": "Only if they already embrace its methodology. Otherwise, the learning curve defeats simplicity."
},
{
"q": "What’s the biggest risk of framework-heavy task tools?",
"a": "That managing the system replaces the act of doing tasks."
