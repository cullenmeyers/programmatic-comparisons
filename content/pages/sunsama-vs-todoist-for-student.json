"persona": "Student",
"constraintSlug": "switching-cost",
"constraint_lens": "You need organization for a short period of time, so any tool that requires daily rituals or long-term commitment creates unnecessary overhead.",
"verdict": {
"winner": "y",
"summary": "Todoist wins for students because it supports lightweight organization without requiring daily planning rituals. Sunsama is designed for intentional daily planning, but that structure rarely pays off over a short academic window. When flexibility and easy exit matter, Todoist fits better.",
"decision_rule": "If daily planning rituals outweigh short-term benefit, Sunsama fails first."

"type": "persona_fit",

"faqs": [
{
"q": "Is Sunsama too much for students?",
"a": "Often yes, because its daily planning focus assumes long-term use and consistent habits."
},
{
"q": "Why is low switching cost important for students?",
"a": "Because academic needs change frequently, and heavy systems can become wasted effort."
},
{
"q": "Can students benefit from Sunsama at all?",
"a": "Yes, especially during intense periods, but it’s rarely ideal for short-term use."
},
{
"q": "What’s the biggest risk of ritual-heavy tools?",
"a": "That maintaining the ritual becomes the work instead of supporting it."
