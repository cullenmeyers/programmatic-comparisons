"a": "Only if you actively benefit from linking events to other content. If you don’t maintain those links, integration becomes extra overhead."

"a": "A standalone calendar like Apple Calendar keeps events separate and requires minimal ongoing effort."

{
"q": "Will I miss features by avoiding workspace calendars?",
"a": "Possibly, but if you don’t need deep integration, avoiding complexity often leads to more consistent use."
},
{
"q": "How do I know if maintenance is becoming a problem?",
"a": "If you spend time adjusting settings or fixing connections instead of simply adding events, the tool may be too complex for your needs."
