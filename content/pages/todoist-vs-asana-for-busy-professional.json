"summary": "Todoist wins for busy professionals who need to log tasks quickly between meetings. It’s built for rapid capture without forcing you into project structure first. Asana is strong for coordinated work, but if you have to think about where a task “belongs” before you can save it, you’ll postpone logging and lose tasks. Follow the decision rule: if project setup slows immediate task entry, Asana fails first.",

The best tool is the one that lets you save a task first and sort it later without making you decide a project structure upfront."

"q": "Which is faster for capturing tasks during a busy day?",
"a": "Todoist is typically better for rapid, low-friction capture because it doesn’t require project decisions before you save the task."

"q": "When does Asana make more sense than Todoist?",
"a": "Asana makes more sense when your tasks are tied to collaborative projects and you need shared visibility, ownership, and structured workflows."
},
{
"q": "How can a busy professional use Asana without slowing down capture?",
"a": "Keep a single default inbox project for quick entry and do sorting in a short batch session later, instead of organizing at the moment of capture."

"q": "What’s the simplest way to avoid task overload in either tool?",
"a": "Use one default capture place, keep tasks short and action-based, and set a consistent daily or weekly cleanup time so your lists don’t become a junk drawer."
