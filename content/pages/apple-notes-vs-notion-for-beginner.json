"summary": "Apple Notes wins for beginners who just want to type immediately. It opens to a simple note list and lets you create a new note with one tap. Notion centers around pages inside workspaces and often introduces database blocks and structured layouts. If databases and page structures must be understood before writing, Notion fails first.",
