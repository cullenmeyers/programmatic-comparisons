"a": "No. Events stay where you place them unless you edit them."
},
{
"q": "Which tool is more minimal?",
"a": "Google Calendar is more minimal because it avoids optimization layers."
},
{
"q": "Can Clockwise be used passively?",
"a": "It integrates with your calendar, but its main feature is automated optimization."
