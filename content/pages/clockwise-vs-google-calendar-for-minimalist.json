"summary": "Google Calendar is the better fit for a Minimalist who wants to see meetings clearly without automated reshuffling. Clockwise optimizes and rearranges events in the background to create focus time.

"q": "How do I know if automation is hurting clarity?",
"a": "If you frequently check or question changes in your schedule, the background optimization may be adding friction."
