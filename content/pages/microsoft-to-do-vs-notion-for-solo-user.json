"summary": "Microsoft To Do wins for solo users who want a stable task list that doesn’t require ongoing system redesign. It stays simple and functional without database tweaking or structural updates.

"faqs": [
{
"q": "Which tool requires less ongoing maintenance?",
"a": "Microsoft To Do requires less maintenance because its structure is fixed and doesn’t rely on customizable databases."
},
{
"q": "Can Notion work as a simple task manager?",
"a": "Yes, but it often becomes more complex over time as you add properties, views, and linked databases."
},
{
"q": "What does maintenance look like in Notion?",
"a": "Maintenance can include reorganizing databases, adjusting filters, cleaning up unused properties, and redesigning layouts to stay usable."
},
{
"q": "Is flexibility always better for a solo user?",
"a": "Not necessarily. If flexibility leads to constant tweaking, it can create friction and system fatigue instead of stability."
