"persona": "Student",
"constraintSlug": "switching-cost",
"constraint_lens": "You only need task tracking for a short academic term, so any structure that doesn’t clearly pay off before exams is unnecessary overhead.",
"verdict": {
"winner": "y",
"summary": "Todoist wins for students because it allows quick task entry without committing to boards or workflows. Trello’s visual structure can be useful, but managing boards often adds work that doesn’t pay off within a single term. When assignments are temporary and deadlines move fast, Todoist keeps effort proportional.",
"decision_rule": "If managing boards outweighs academic benefit, Trello fails first."

{
"q": "Is Trello overkill for most students?",
"a": "Often yes, because its board management rarely pays off within a single academic term."

"q": "Why is Todoist better for assignments?",
"a": "Because it focuses on capturing and completing tasks without setup or maintenance."
},
{
"q": "Can students still use Trello effectively?",
"a": "Yes, especially for one complex project, but it’s usually unnecessary for general coursework."
},
{
"q": "What’s the biggest student mistake with task tools?",
"a": "Choosing a system designed for long-term projects when their need is temporary."
