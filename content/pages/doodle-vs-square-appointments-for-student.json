"summary": "Doodle is the better fit for a student who needs to quickly coordinate group availability for a short project. Square Appointments is structured around service booking and payment workflows. If service booking setup takes longer than the project itself, Doodle keeps scheduling lightweight and temporary.",

With short-term use and low switching cost as priorities, the tool must be quick to set up and easy to discard.
