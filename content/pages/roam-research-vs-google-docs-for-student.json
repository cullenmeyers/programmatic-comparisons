"persona": "Student",
"constraint_lens": "You need a tool that works for one semester and is easy to leave later without losing access or retraining yourself.",
"verdict": {
"winner": "y",
"summary": "Google Docs wins for students who need straightforward academic notes and easy submission. It matches common classroom workflows and requires no special concepts to start writing. Roam Research introduces backlinks, blocks, and graph thinking that take time to learn. If learning the tool outweighs the academic payoff, Roam fails first.",

{
"type": "persona_fit",
"heading": "Best fit for short-term academic use",
"content": "You need notes mainly to study and submit assignments, not to build a lifelong knowledge system. Google Docs fits typical school expectations because teachers accept shared links or standard document files. Roam focuses on networked note-taking, which may be more than you need for one semester."

"point": "Automatic backlinks between concepts",
"why_it_matters": "Typing double brackets creates links between topics across notes. This helps connect ideas during studying, but requires learning how linking works."

{
"point": "Block-based outline structure",
"why_it_matters": "Each line can be nested and rearranged as a block. This supports structured thinking, yet differs from traditional document formatting."
},
{
"point": "Graph view of topic relationships",
"why_it_matters": "You can visualize how subjects connect. This can deepen understanding, though it adds features unrelated to assignment submission."

},
{
"point": "Direct sharing through links and common file downloads",
"why_it_matters": "You can share with classmates or export as common formats accepted by school portals. This keeps switching costs low."

{
"point": "Commenting and suggestion tools built into the editor",
"why_it_matters": "Teachers and peers can leave feedback directly in the document. This matches how assignments are reviewed."
