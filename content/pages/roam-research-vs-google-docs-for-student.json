"persona": "Student",
"constraint_lens": "You need notes for short-term academic work with low switching cost, so any learning curve that doesn’t pay off within a course is wasted effort.",
"verdict": {
"winner": "y",
"summary": "Google Docs wins for students because it delivers immediate usefulness for studying and submitting assignments. Roam Research offers powerful linking, but the time required to learn its approach often exceeds the academic payoff within a single term. When speed, familiarity, and easy handoff matter, Google Docs fits student reality better.",
"decision_rule": "If learning the tool outweighs the academic payoff, Roam fails first."

"type": "persona_fit",

"content": "Students need tools that support lectures, studying, and assignment submission without demanding long-term commitment. The best option works immediately, collaborates easily, and can be abandoned after the course with no regret."

"point": "Assignments are easy to share and submit",
"why_it_matters": "Docs aligns with common academic workflows, reducing friction when deadlines approach."

"point": "Switching or stopping later is painless",

"faqs": [
{
"q": "Is Roam Research bad for students?",
"a": "Not inherently, but its learning curve often doesn’t pay off within a single course."
},
{
"q": "Why is Google Docs better for assignments?",
"a": "Because it’s widely accepted, easy to share, and requires no setup to submit work."
},
{
"q": "Can I use Roam and Google Docs together?",
"a": "Yes. Use Google Docs for coursework and Roam only if you’re intentionally building long-term knowledge."
},
{
"q": "What’s the biggest mistake students make with note tools?",
"a": "Choosing a system optimized for long-term thinking when their need is short-term academic performance."
