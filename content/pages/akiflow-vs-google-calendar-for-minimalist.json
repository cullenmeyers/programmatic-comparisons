"verdict": {
"winner": "y",
"summary": "Google Calendar wins for minimalists who only want to see meetings on a clean grid. It focuses on time based events without mixing in task inboxes or scheduling workflows. Akiflow blends tasks and calendar blocks into one planning screen, which adds extra panels and decisions. If task integration adds unnecessary interface layers, Akiflow fails first.",

{
"type": "persona_fit",
"heading": "Why this matters for Minimalists",
"content": "You said you want events only, not blended task planning layers. As a minimalist, extra sidebars, inbox panels, and drag to schedule workflows feel like noise when you just want to see your meetings. The cleaner the calendar grid, the better."

"bullets": [
{
"point": "Unified inbox that pulls tasks from tools like Notion, Slack, and Asana into one panel",
"why_it_matters": "You can review tasks and schedule them onto your calendar in one place, but this creates an always visible task layer that a minimalist may not want."
},
{
"point": "Drag tasks directly onto time slots to create calendar blocks",
"why_it_matters": "This makes time blocking efficient if you plan your day actively, yet it adds another interaction step beyond simply viewing meetings."
},
{
"point": "Dedicated planning mode that separates inbox processing from calendar view",
"why_it_matters": "Power users may like switching between modes, but the presence of modes and panels adds structure that can feel unnecessary if you only care about events."

{
"type": "y_wins",
"heading": "Where Google Calendar wins",
"bullets": [
{
"point": "Default view shows only time based events on a day, week, or month grid",
"why_it_matters": "You open the app and immediately see meetings without a task inbox or planning sidebar competing for attention."
},
{
"point": "Event creation form focuses on title, time, guests, and location",
"why_it_matters": "There are no built in task scheduling workflows layered into the same screen, so adding or viewing meetings stays straightforward."
},
{
"point": "Optional task features are separated and not required for basic use",
"why_it_matters": "You can ignore task lists entirely and still use the calendar fully, keeping the interface centered on events only."

{
"type": "edge_case",

"faqs": [
{
"q": "Does Google Calendar have tasks at all?",
"a": "Yes, but task features are optional and can be ignored, so the main calendar view stays focused on scheduled events."
},
{
"q": "Is Akiflow a calendar or a task manager?",
"a": "It combines both by pulling tasks from other apps and letting you schedule them on your calendar, which adds extra layers beyond basic event viewing."
},
{
"q": "Which one is better for just seeing meetings?",
"a": "Google Calendar is usually clearer because it centers the interface on time based events without showing a planning inbox by default."
},
{
"q": "Will I miss features if I choose Google Calendar?",
"a": "You may miss advanced task scheduling workflows, but if you only want to see and add meetings, those extra layers are not necessary."
