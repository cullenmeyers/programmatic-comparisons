{
"q": "Can I use Akiflow in a minimalist way?",
"a": "You can limit feature use, but its core design centers on task-calendar integration, which may still add layers."

{
"q": "How do I know if integration is hurting clarity?",
"a": "If you hesitate or navigate extra panels before understanding your day, the added layers may be reducing clarity."
