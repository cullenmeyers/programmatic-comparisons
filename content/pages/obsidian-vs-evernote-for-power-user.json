"summary": "Obsidian wins for power users building a scalable second brain. It stores notes as markdown files with full bidirectional linking, graph view, and deep plugin support. Evernote focuses on notebooks and tags with limited extensibility and no graph-level control. If plugin extensibility and graph-level control are constrained, Evernote fails first.",

"content": "You build a long-term knowledge system with heavy linking and customization. As a power user, you care about how far the tool can stretch over years. The right tool must allow structural depth, automation, and control over how notes connect. If the system limits linking or customization, you will eventually outgrow it."

{
"q": "Is Obsidian better for building a second brain?",
"a": "Yes, especially if you value bidirectional links, graph view, and plugin-based extensions for custom workflows."

{
"q": "Does Evernote support deep linking between notes?",
"a": "It supports internal links, but it does not provide full graph visualization or plugin extensibility."

"q": "Which tool scales better over many years?",

"q": "Is Evernote too limited for power users?",
