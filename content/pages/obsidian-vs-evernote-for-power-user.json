"summary": "Obsidian wins for power users building a long-term, highly customized second brain. It offers deep linking, graph views, and plugin extensibility that expand as your system grows. Evernote is polished and structured, but if plugin extensibility and graph-level control are constrained, it limits long-term scalability. Follow the rule: if plugin extensibility and graph-level control are constrained, Evernote fails first.",

"faqs": [
{
"q": "Which tool has the higher long-term ceiling?",
"a": "Obsidian generally has the higher ceiling due to its plugin ecosystem, graph view, and file-level control."

{
"q": "Is Evernote too limiting for power users?",
"a": "It can be if you need deep customization, advanced linking, and system extensibility beyond built-in features."
},
{
"q": "What makes a second brain scalable?",
"a": "Deep linking, flexible structure, extensibility, and the ability to evolve the system without hitting hard limits."
},
{
"q": "When might Evernote still be the better choice?",
"a": "If you value a polished capture experience and don’t need graph-level control or plugin-based expansion."
