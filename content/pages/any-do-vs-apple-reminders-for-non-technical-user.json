"winner": "y",
"summary": "Apple Reminders wins for non-technical users because it feels native and predictable across devices. Any.do adds layers of UI and syncing behavior that can feel uncertain or inconsistent. When confidence and peace of mind matter more than features, Apple Reminders feels safer to rely on.",

"a": "Not unreliable, but its cross-platform syncing and UI changes can feel unpredictable to fear-averse users."

"q": "What makes a task app feel safe?",
"a": "Predictable behavior, invisible syncing, and very few ways to configure it incorrectly."
