"summary": "Todoist wins for students who only need to track coursework for the current semester. You can create projects for each class and add tasks in a simple list without designing boards.

{
"q": "Is Todoist better for short-term school use?",
"a": "Yes. Its list-based projects are fast to create and easy to remove after the semester."
},
{
"q": "Does MeisterTask require board setup?",
"a": "Yes. You typically create columns and organize tasks visually before using it fully."
},
{
"q": "Which tool is easier to stop using after finals?",
"a": "Todoist is easier to leave because you can archive or delete projects without dismantling board layouts."
},
{
"q": "Can MeisterTask work for solo students?",
"a": "Yes, but its board system is often more useful for collaborative or visual workflows."
