"verdict": {
"winner": "y",
"summary": "Trello wins for busy professionals because it provides lightweight visual task tracking without heavy communication layers. Basecamp combines tasks with messaging, discussions, and coordination features that can dilute clarity. When you need fast visibility rather than project chatter, Trello keeps the focus on tasks.",
