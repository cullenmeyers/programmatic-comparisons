"meta_description": "A clear comparison of Obsidian vs Google Docs for students who need short-term notes and easy collaboration on class projects.",
"persona": "Student",
"constraint_lens": "You need notes for short-term academic use with classmates, so the best tool is easy to share and abandon without friction.",
"verdict": {
"winner": "y",
"summary": "Google Docs wins for students because it supports effortless sharing and collaboration with almost no setup. Obsidian is powerful for personal knowledge systems, but exporting and coordinating notes adds friction that doesn’t pay off within a single semester. When collaboration and low switching cost matter most, Google Docs fits the reality of student work better.",
"decision_rule": "If exporting or sharing notes feels heavy for short-term use, Obsidian fails first."

"heading": "What students need for short-term collaboration",
"content": "Students often work under time pressure with changing groups and deadlines. The right tool makes sharing effortless, works immediately, and doesn’t lock you into a system you won’t use after the semester ends."

"bullets": [
{
"point": "Your notes are mostly private and rarely shared",

"point": "You plan to keep and reuse notes beyond the semester",
"why_it_matters": "Obsidian’s value compounds over time. For purely temporary coursework, that payoff usually never arrives."

"point": "You’re comfortable exporting and managing files",
"why_it_matters": "If file handling feels natural, sharing notes won’t be stressful. For most students, it adds unnecessary friction."

"point": "Sharing is instant and familiar",

"point": "Real-time collaboration is built in",
"why_it_matters": "Students don’t need to coordinate versions or exports, which reduces confusion and wasted time."

{
"point": "Walking away later is painless",
"why_it_matters": "After the semester, you can stop using Docs without feeling like you invested heavily in a system."

"faqs": [
{
"q": "Is Obsidian bad for group projects?",
"a": "Not inherently, but it adds friction for sharing and collaboration that rarely makes sense for short-term student work."
},
{
"q": "Why is Google Docs better for students?",
"a": "Because it’s familiar, easy to share, and optimized for real-time collaboration with minimal setup."
},
{
"q": "Can I still use Obsidian alongside Google Docs?",
"a": "Yes. Use Google Docs for shared class work and Obsidian only for personal notes you plan to keep long-term."

{
"q": "What’s the biggest mistake students make with note tools?",
"a": "Choosing a long-term personal system when their immediate need is short-term collaboration."
