"summary": "Trello wins for beginners who just want to move tasks visually on a board. You create a board and start dragging cards between columns right away. Airtable centers on tables with fields, column types, and views that require setup decisions. If database fields and table structure must be configured before use, Airtable fails first.",

{
"q": "Is Airtable a task manager or a database?",
"a": "It functions like a flexible database with task views, which can feel complex for beginners."

"q": "Is Trello easier for visual task movement?",
"a": "Yes. You can drag cards across columns without configuring fields."

{
"q": "Which tool requires less setup?",

{
"q": "Can Airtable be used visually?",
"a": "Yes, through Kanban view, but it still depends on an underlying table structure."
