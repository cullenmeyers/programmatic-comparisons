"verdict": {
"winner": "x",
"summary": "Obsidian wins for power users building an extensible personal knowledge base. It supports community plugins, graph view, and deep linking between notes. Notebooks Alfons Schmid focuses on document and folder organization with fewer workflow extensions. If plugin-driven workflows and graph-level linking are constrained, Notebooks Alfons Schmid fails first.",

{
"q": "Does Obsidian require plugins to be powerful?",

{
"q": "Is Notebooks Alfons Schmid extensible?",
"a": "It supports structured documents and tasks but lacks a broad community plugin system."

{
"q": "Which handles graph-style knowledge better?",
"a": "Obsidian is built around backlinks and a visual graph of connections."
},
{
"q": "Which has the higher ceiling?",
"a": "Obsidian generally has the higher ceiling due to its plugin ecosystem and linking model."
