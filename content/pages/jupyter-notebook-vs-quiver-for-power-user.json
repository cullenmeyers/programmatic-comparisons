"verdict": {
"winner": "x",
"summary": "Jupyter Notebook wins for power users combining executable code and research notes. It runs live code cells connected to an active kernel and displays outputs inline. Quiver supports code cells, but they are static snippets without a native execution environment. If live code cells and execution environments are not native, Quiver fails first.",

{
"type": "persona_fit",
"heading": "Best fit for executable research workflows",
"content": "You write research notes that require running code and inspecting results immediately. Jupyter Notebook connects each code cell to a live kernel so you can execute, rerun, and inspect variables. Quiver allows mixing Markdown and code blocks, but execution is not built into the notebook environment."

{
"q": "Does Quiver execute code natively?",
"a": "It supports code cells, but execution is not built into the app environment."
},
{
"q": "Can Jupyter display plots inline?",
"a": "Yes. Outputs such as charts and tables appear directly under the executed cell."
},
{
"q": "Is Jupyter limited to one programming language?",
"a": "No. It supports multiple language kernels such as Python and R."
},
{
"q": "Which has the higher ceiling for computational research?",
"a": "Jupyter Notebook has the higher ceiling because it integrates execution with documentation."
