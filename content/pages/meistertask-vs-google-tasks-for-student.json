"summary": "Google Tasks wins for students who only need assignment tracking for the current term. It lets you create lists directly inside Gmail or Google Calendar with almost no setup.

{
"q": "Which tool is easier to stop using after the term?",
"a": "Google Tasks is easier to abandon because it requires minimal structure."
},
{
"q": "Can MeisterTask be used solo?",
"a": "Yes, but its board structure is often more beneficial for collaborative or multi stage projects."
