"persona": "Student",
"constraint_lens": "You only need task tracking for a short academic term, so any board setup or structure that doesn’t pay off before exams is unnecessary effort.",
"verdict": {
"winner": "y",
"summary": "Google Tasks wins for students because it allows immediate assignment tracking without committing to boards or workflows. MeisterTask’s visual boards can be useful, but managing them rarely pays off within a single semester. When switching cost and simplicity matter, Google Tasks stays proportional to the need.",

"q": "What’s the biggest student mistake with task apps?",
