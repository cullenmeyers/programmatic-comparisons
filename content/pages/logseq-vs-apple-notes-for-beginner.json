"summary": "Apple Notes wins for beginners who are curious about linked notes but don’t want to manage setup steps. It opens to a simple note list and syncs automatically without choosing folders or installing plugins. Logseq relies on local folders, graph files, and optional plugins that require understanding how the system works. If local file setup and plugin concepts must be understood first, Logseq fails first.",
