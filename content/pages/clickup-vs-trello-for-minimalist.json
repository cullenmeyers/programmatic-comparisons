"constraint_lens": "You are averse to features, so the best visual task tool is the one that shows tasks clearly without configuration or system management.",
"verdict": {
"winner": "y",
"summary": "Trello wins for minimalists because it offers visual task tracking without forcing configuration or system thinking. ClickUp’s flexibility introduces options that quickly exceed simple needs. When you just want to see tasks move without managing structure, Trello stays out of the way.",

"faqs": [
{
"q": "Is ClickUp too much for minimalists?",
"a": "Often yes, because its many configuration options add mental overhead."
},
{
"q": "Why does Trello feel simpler?",
"a": "Because it limits structure to boards and cards with very little setup."
},
{
"q": "Can a minimalist still use ClickUp?",
"a": "Yes, but only by intentionally ignoring most features."
},
{
"q": "What makes a visual task tool feel calm?",
"a": "Clear boards, few options, and no pressure to customize."
