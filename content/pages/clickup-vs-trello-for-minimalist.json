"verdict": {
"winner": "y",
"summary": "Trello wins for minimalists who want visual task tracking without heavy structure. It centers on simple boards with cards that are easy to scan. ClickUp presents spaces, folders, custom fields, and multiple view types that add setup and options. If configuration options exceed task needs, ClickUp fails first.",

{

"content": "You said you want to see tasks without managing structure. As a minimalist, too many menus, settings, and configuration panels create friction before you even move a task. A board that works out of the box feels cleaner."

"q": "Which tool feels cleaner visually?",

{
"q": "Can ClickUp be simplified?",
"a": "You can reduce features, but its interface still presents multiple structural layers."
