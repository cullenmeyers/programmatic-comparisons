"summary": "Google Docs wins for students because it makes sharing, collaborating, and submitting assignments effortless. Craft offers a polished writing experience, but exporting and coordinating files can add friction that doesn’t pay off within a single term. When deadlines and collaboration matter most, Google Docs fits student workflows better.",
