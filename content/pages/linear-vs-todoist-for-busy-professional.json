"persona": "Busy professional",
"constraint_lens": "You face time scarcity and cognitive overload, so any tool that introduces issue-tracking structure before simple execution creates friction.",
"verdict": {
"winner": "y",
"summary": "Todoist wins for busy professionals because it allows fast task capture without engineering-style structure. Linear is optimized for issue tracking, which assumes projects, cycles, and workflow states. When your goal is to execute daily work tasks quickly, Todoist reduces cognitive overhead.",
"decision_rule": "If issue-tracking concepts slow simple task entry, Linear fails first."

{
"type": "persona_fit",

{
"point": "Your work already lives inside structured issue tracking",

},
{
"point": "You need status visibility across teams",
"why_it_matters": "If coordination is central, issue states and cycles add clarity rather than friction."
},

"point": "You are comfortable with workflow concepts",
"why_it_matters": "Users familiar with issue tracking may not feel slowed down, but others will."

"faqs": [
{
"q": "Is Linear too structured for personal task tracking?",
"a": "Often yes, because it assumes issue-tracking workflows before simple execution."
},
{
"q": "Why does Todoist feel lighter?",
"a": "Because it focuses on adding and completing tasks without engineering-style structure."
},
{
"q": "Can busy professionals still use Linear effectively?",
"a": "Yes, especially when their work requires formal issue tracking."
},
{
"q": "What’s the biggest risk of workflow-heavy tools when busy?",
"a": "That choosing states and structure consumes time meant for actual work."
