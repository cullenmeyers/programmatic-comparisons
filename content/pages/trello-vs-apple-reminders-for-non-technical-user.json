"verdict": {
"winner": "y",
"summary": "Apple Reminders wins for non-technical users because it treats tasks as simple items to remember, not objects to manage. Trello’s boards and cards introduce visible workflows that can feel fragile or easy to misuse. When confidence and predictability matter most, Apple Reminders feels safer and calmer.",

"q": "Is Trello bad for non-technical users?",
"a": "Not inherently, but its visual workflow can create anxiety for users who fear doing something wrong."

"q": "Can a non-technical user grow into Trello later?",
"a": "Yes, once confidence increases and visual workflows feel helpful instead of risky."
},
{
"q": "What’s the biggest risk of visual task tools?",
"a": "That interaction feels like manipulation rather than simple remembering."
