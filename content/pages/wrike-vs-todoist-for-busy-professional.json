"verdict": {
"winner": "y",
"summary": "Todoist wins for busy professionals because it enables fast execution without enterprise planning overhead. Wrike is built for structured, large-scale coordination, which adds layers before tasks feel actionable. When work happens between meetings and time is tight, Todoist keeps attention on doing.",
