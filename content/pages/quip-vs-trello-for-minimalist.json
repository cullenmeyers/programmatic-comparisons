"summary": "Trello wins for minimalists who want a simple task board. It centers on lists and cards without forcing documents or spreadsheets into the same space. Quip blends documents, spreadsheets, and task lists inside shared workspaces, which adds extra layers to manage. If document collaboration layers add unnecessary complexity, Quip fails first.",
