"verdict": {
"winner": "y",
"summary": "Trello wins for minimalists who want a simple task board without blending documents and collaboration layers. Its board-and-card model keeps tasks visually separated from long-form content. Quip combines documents and tasks, but if document collaboration layers add unnecessary complexity, it creates friction for someone who just wants clean task tracking. Follow the rule: if document collaboration layers add unnecessary complexity, Quip fails first.",
