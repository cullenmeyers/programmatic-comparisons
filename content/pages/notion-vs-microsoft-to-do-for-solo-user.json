"verdict": {
"winner": "y",
"summary": "Microsoft To Do wins for solo users because it remains usable over time without requiring system maintenance. Notion’s flexibility often leads to task lists that need periodic restructuring to stay clear. When you want tasks to quietly persist without tuning, Microsoft To Do fits better.",

"a": "Often yes, because flexible task setups can degrade without periodic restructuring."
