"winner": "y",
"summary": "Things 3 wins for minimalists who want a clean task list without daily planning rituals. It centers on straightforward lists and light structure, not mandatory planning layers. Sunsama is built around daily planning workflows, but if mandatory daily planning layers add extra interaction steps, it creates friction for someone who just wants a simple list. Follow the rule: if mandatory daily planning layers add extra interaction steps, Sunsama fails first.",
