"summary": "Things 3 wins for minimalists who want a clean list of what to do. It centers on projects and simple lists without automatically scheduling tasks into time blocks.

{
"q": "Does Sorted³ require time blocking?",
"a": "It strongly encourages mapping tasks into time slots through its scheduling view."

{
"q": "Is Things 3 minimal by design?",
"a": "Yes, it focuses on clean lists and light structure without automatic scheduling."
},
{
"q": "Which tool keeps tasks more stable?",
"a": "Things 3 keeps tasks stable because it does not auto rearrange them."
},
{
"q": "Can I ignore scheduling features in Sorted³?",
"a": "You can, but the app is centered around its time mapping system, which remains prominent."
