"verdict": {
"winner": "y",
"summary": "Things 3 wins for minimalists because it presents tasks clearly without pushing time-blocking or automated scheduling. Sorted³ centers its experience around scheduling and rearranging time, which can feel like extra work. When you simply want to see what to do next, Things 3 stays calmer and more focused.",

{
"q": "Is Sorted³ too active for minimalists?",
"a": "Often yes, because its scheduling features encourage ongoing interaction with time blocks."
},
{
"q": "Why does Things 3 feel calmer?",
"a": "Because it centers on clear lists rather than dynamic scheduling."
},
{
"q": "Can a minimalist still use Sorted³?",
"a": "Yes, but only if they are comfortable with time-based interaction."
},
{
"q": "What makes a task tool feel minimalist?",
"a": "Static clarity, optional scheduling, and minimal required interaction."
