"summary": "Google Calendar is the better choice for a Beginner who just wants to see their schedule and add events. Calendly assumes you’ll configure event types and booking links before it becomes useful. If setup around booking flows is required before you can simply add a meeting, Google Calendar keeps things straightforward.",

Google Calendar lets you create events immediately, while Calendly is designed around configuring meeting types and sharing booking links."
