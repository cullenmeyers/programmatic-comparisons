"summary": "Google Calendar wins for beginners who just want to see their schedule and add events. You can click a date, enter a title and time, and save without configuring anything else. Calendly is built around event types and booking links that must be defined before others can schedule with you.

As a beginner, screens asking you to define meeting types, availability rules, or public links create extra steps before you even add a simple appointment. A direct event entry flow fits you better."
