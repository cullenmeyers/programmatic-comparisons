"verdict": {
"winner": "y",
"summary": "Apple Notes wins for non-technical users who want private notes without thinking about technical details. It uses device-level security and optional Face ID without asking you to manage keys or encryption terms. Standard Notes introduces language around encryption, accounts, and extensions that can feel risky if you are unsure what they do.

{
"type": "persona_fit",
"heading": "Best fit for someone who fears breaking things",
"content": "You want safe personal notes without worrying about settings or mistakes. Apple Notes feels built into your iPhone or Mac, so there are fewer new concepts to learn. Standard Notes talks openly about encryption, keys, and account setup, which can make you wonder if one wrong click could lock you out."

"bullets": [
{
"point": "End-to-end encryption by default with zero-knowledge design",
"why_it_matters": "Your notes are encrypted before leaving your device, which means even the company cannot read them. For someone highly focused on privacy, this removes doubt about who can access the data."

{
"point": "Optional extensions system for editors and themes",
"why_it_matters": "You can add features like different editors or themes through extensions. This allows deeper control, but it also introduces extra switches that may feel risky if you are unsure what they change."

{
"point": "Manual account creation with password-based recovery",
"why_it_matters": "You create a dedicated account and password that controls access to your notes. This gives clear ownership, but if you forget the password, recovery is limited, which can feel stressful."

"heading": "Where Apple Notes wins",
"bullets": [
{
"point": "Built into iOS and macOS with automatic iCloud sync",

{
"point": "Lock note feature using Face ID, Touch ID, or device passcode",
"why_it_matters": "You can lock individual notes with the same method you already use to unlock your phone. There are no encryption terms to understand, which lowers anxiety about making a mistake."

{
"point": "No visible encryption settings or technical language in daily use",
"why_it_matters": "Security runs in the background as part of the Apple ecosystem. Because you are not asked to manage keys or settings, there is less fear that one wrong change could break access."
